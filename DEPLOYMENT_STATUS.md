## Current Status: ⚠️ Railway Deployment Limited

### Issue Summary
The website deployment on Railway has encountered plan limitations that prevent successful deployment.

**Error Details:**
- Railway deployment fails with message: "Your account is on a limited plan"
- Custom domain `mayurprabhune.in` returns `502 Bad Gateway`
- Web service URL `web-production-c7f8.up.railway.app` returns `404 Not Found`

### Current Configuration Status
✅ **Completed Successfully:**
- GitHub repository setup and code push
- Railway project connection
- Environment variables configuration (email, database)
- Custom domain DNS configuration (CNAME → Railway)
- PostgreSQL database setup
- Email service configuration (Titan Email)
- Application code optimization

❌ **Blocked by Plan Limitations:**
- Web application deployment
- SSL certificate provisioning
- Public website accessibility

## Technical Analysis

### Railway Plan Limitations
Railway's free tier appears to have usage restrictions that prevent the deployment from completing. The application files are uploaded and compressed successfully, but the deployment fails at the execution stage.

### Infrastructure Status
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL configured and accessible
2. **Domain**: DNS correctly pointing to Railway (CNAME record)
3. **SSL**: Certificate provisioning blocked by deployment failure
4. **Email**: Titan Email service properly configured
5. **Code**: Application fully prepared and optimized

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Railway Plan Upgrade (Recommended)
**Cost**: Starting at $5/month for Developer plan
**Benefits**:
- Keep current configuration
- Custom domain with SSL
- Full database access
- Immediate deployment

**Action Required**:
1. Visit railway.com/account/plans
2. Upgrade to Developer plan or higher
3. Redeploy application: `railway up`

### Option 2: Alternative Free Platforms

#### 2.1 Render (Free Tier)
```bash
# Setup steps:
1. Connect GitHub repository to Render
2. Configure build: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure start: gunicorn wsgi:app
4. Add environment variables
5. Configure custom domain (requires paid plan)
```

#### 2.2 Fly.io (Free Tier)
```bash
# Setup steps:
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
flyctl domains add mayurprabhune.in
```

#### 2.3 Railway Alternative Setup
```bash
# If upgrading Railway plan:
railway up  # This should work after plan upgrade
```

### Option 3: VPS Deployment
**Providers**: DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr ($5/month)
**Benefits**: Full control, custom domain, SSL

## Current File Status

### Application Files Ready for Deployment
- `simple_app.py`: Minimal Flask app for testing
- `wsgi.py`: Production WSGI entry point
- `Procfile`: Railway deployment configuration
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- Complete Flask application in `app/` directory

### Domain Configuration
- Domain: mayurprabhune.in
- DNS: CNAME record pointing to Railway
- Status: Ready for SSL certificate (pending deployment)

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1: Resolve Railway Plan Limitation
1. **Review Railway pricing**: Visit railway.com/account/plans
2. **Upgrade account**: Select appropriate plan ($5/month minimum)
3. **Redeploy**: Run `railway up` after upgrade

### Priority 2: Alternative Platform Setup (If not upgrading)
1. Choose alternative platform (Render recommended)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Configure environment variables
4. Update DNS records if needed

### Priority 3: SSL Certificate
After successful deployment on any platform:
1. Configure custom domain
2. Enable SSL certificate
3. Test HTTPS access

## Testing Checklist (Post-Deployment)

Once deployment is successful:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Contact form sends emails
- [ ] Admin login functions
