# Project Directory Summary

Based on the files and folders in your workspace, here is a summary of the project structure:

The project appears to be a personal portfolio or business website for an AI mentor. It seems to be composed of several parts, including a main website, an admin section, and potentially some standalone pages or scripts.

## Project Structure Overview:

*   **Root Directory**: The main directory contains a mix of files that suggest a web project.
    *   `index.html`: The main landing page of the website.
    *   `services.html`, `sucess story page.html`: Additional pages for the main site.
    *   Python files like `About me.py`, `blog page.py`, and `testimonial.py`: These could be individual scripts for generating pages or backend logic, but they are not organized in a typical web framework structure.
    *   `app.jsx`: A React component file, which suggests that parts of the frontend might be built with React.

*   **`admin/` Directory**: This folder contains the administrative interface for the website.
    *   `dashboard.html`: The main dashboard page for administrators.
    *   `login.html`: The login page for the admin section.
    *   `video pages.html`: A page for managing videos.

*   **`js/` Directory**: This holds the client-side JavaScript code.
    *   `app.js`: The main JavaScript file for the application's frontend logic.

*   **`success story/` Directory**: This contains a nested static page, possibly a case study or a separate project.
    *   `success story/stitch_ai_mentor_home_page/ai_mentor_success_stories_page/code.html`: A standalone HTML page.

## Architectural Observations:

*   The project seems to be a collection of static HTML pages with some backend functionality suggested by the Python files.
*   The file organization is not following a standard web framework convention (like Flask or Django), where you would typically see `templates` and `static` folders at the top level.
*   There's a mix of technologies (plain HTML, Python, React JSX), which might indicate different parts of the site were built at different times or with different approaches.
