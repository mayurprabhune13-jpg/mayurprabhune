      "title": "What Makes AI Leadership Different",
      "content": "AI leadership differs from traditional technology leadership in three fundamental ways. First, AI projects involve uncertainty and experimentation unlike traditional software projects with clear requirements. Leaders must be comfortable with ambiguity and create space for iterative learning. Second, AI requires cross-functional collaboration between technical teams, business users, and domain experts. Your role is facilitating this collaboration and ensuring all perspectives integrate effectively. Third, AI has significant ethical and social implications, especially in Indian contexts requiring cultural sensitivity, fairness across diverse populations, and responsible innovation benefiting society.",
